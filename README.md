# librejam-omnom

Librejam omnom is a simple script for accepting game jam submissions over IRC,
with git links or direct archive links.

It requires `ii-ssl`, `git`, `curl`, and potentially others. bashisms are
avoided.

To run, edit the `librejam-irc`, substituting in relative path and jam
information, then simply do…

`$ sh librejam-irc`

… everything should be good.
